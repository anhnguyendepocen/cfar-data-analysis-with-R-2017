# Data Analysis and Visualization with R

Data Analysis and Visualization with R is a two-day Duke and UNC workshop. The workshop will be held in the CRTP classroom in Hock Plaza, 2424 Erwin Road on August 14-15, 2017. This FREE workshop is only for researchers and staff affiliated with the Duke and UNC Center for AIDS Research (CFAR).

The course will be limited to a maximum of 30 participants on a first-come-first served basis. Registration indicates a commitment to attend BOTH days of the workshop. No programming experience is required. You will be required to bring your own laptop to the workshop.

If you are interested in attending, please send the following information to Kelly Plonk:

    - If No, please give name of CFAR-associated PI.
- R Programming experience:
    - None
    - Some exposure (e..g. previous workshop, online course)
    - Currently using R in research
- Short statement (one paragraph) on how you anticipate using R in your research.

More information can be found on the [course website]().

## Pre-workshop activities

You should be able to find out and achieve the following on your own:

- Install R
- Install RStudio
- Install the `tidyverse` package

If this is beyond you, the workshop will likely be of little benefit. The workshop will assume that all participants have R, RStudio and `tidyverse` installed and ready to go.
